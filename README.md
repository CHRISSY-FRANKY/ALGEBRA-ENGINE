# ALGEBRA ENGINE

Throw at it any algebra based problem or equation(s) to solve, simplify, foil, graph, etc. 

Will be the base engine for higher engines such as Pre-Calc, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Statistics, etc. 

They will be the base engines for even higher mathematics such as Differential Equations, Complex Analysis, Stochastic Processes, etc.

## Note to self üìù

- Creating a model that categorizes inputs and selects the most appropriate functions using classification may be beneficial by offering an efficient approach towards the scalability of functions and techniques.
